# virtual-bird(Still in the developing)
  A repository for studying virtual characters technique.  
  Can not yet be made use of for smoothly real-time application now.  
  But it will!üê±‚ÄçüöÄ
## About The Project
  This project aims to apply different face/body alignment algorithm on virtual character synchronizing.  
  ~~And promote my coding level.~~
## Timeline
  - support OpenCV Head Pose Estimation `2021/12/26`
  - support OpenCV Gaze Tracking `2021/12/08`
  - support [1adrianb][1adrianb/face-alignment] facial landmarks detector `2021/12/08`
  - support [Ghost][Unity Technologies / Ghost] character `2021/12/08`
## Roadmap
  - Algorithm
    - Landmarks Detection
      - [x] [1adrianb / face-alignment][1adrianb/face-alignment]
      - [ ] [Dlib](http://dlib.net/)
    - Gaze Tracking
      - [x] OpenCV moments(simple)
    - Head Alignment
      - [x] OpenCV solvePnP
    - Face Expression Detection `Under Planning`
    - Pose Estimation `Under Planning`
    - Hand Tracking / Gesture Recognition `Under Planning`
  - Unity Model
    - 3D
      - [x] [Unity Technologies / Ghost][]
    - 2D `Under Planning`
  - Android Support `Under Planning`
  - iOS Support `Under Planning`

# virtual-bird(Still in the developing)
  A repository for studying virtual characters technique  
  Can not yet be made use of for smoothly real-time application now
## About The Project
  This project aims to apply different face/body alignment algorithm on virtual character synchronizing.  ~~(and promote my coding level)~~.
## Done List
- Algorithm
  - Landmarks Detection
    - [x] [1adrianb / face-alignment](https://github.com/1adrianb/face-alignment)
  - Gaze Tracking
    - [x] OpenCV moments(simple)
- Unity Model
  - 3D
    - [x] [Unity Technologies / Ghost](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/tutorials/3d-beginner-tutorial-resources-143848)
## To-do List
- Algorithm
  - Landmarks Detection
    - [ ] [Dlib](http://dlib.net/)
  - [ ] Head Alignment
  - [ ] Face Expression Detection
- Unity Model
  - [ ] 2D

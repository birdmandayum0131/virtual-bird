# virtual-bird(Still in the developing)
  A repository for studying virtual characters technique.  
  Can not yet be made use of for smoothly real-time application now.  
  But it will!üê±‚ÄçüöÄ
## About The Project
  This project aims to apply different face/body alignment algorithm on virtual character synchronizing.  
  ~~And promote my coding level.~~
## Timeline
  - support Dlib Face/Landmarks Detector `2022/01/03`
  - change development environment to newer version(~~Of course, not hardware~~üò¢) `2021/12/27`
  - support OpenCV Head Pose Estimation `2021/12/26`
  - support OpenCV Gaze Tracking `2021/12/08`
  - support [FAN][] facial landmarks detector `2021/12/08`
  - support [Ghost][] character `2021/12/08`

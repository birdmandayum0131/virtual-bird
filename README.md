# virtual-bird(Still in the developing)
  ![kenyx-94670](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34616769/147909406-12864407-eb5b-4e3a-a076-afbd58a301f2.gif)  
  A repository for studying virtual characters technique.  
  Can not yet be made use of for smoothly real-time application now.  
  But it will!üê±‚ÄçüöÄ  
## About The Project
  This project aims to apply different face/body alignment algorithm on virtual character synchronizing.  
  ~~And promote my coding level.~~   
## Getting Started
The following steps will install required packages and run the demo program.
And the tutorial is based on anaconda environment.
### Prerequisites
I use these packages to develop the project.
- [FAN][]
```
conda install -c 1adrianb face_alignment
```
- numpy
```
conda install -c anaconda numpy
```
- OpenCV
```
conda install -c conda-forge opencv
```
- Dlib  

**You can build cuda-supported dlib by yourself, and it may be faster.**
```
conda install -c conda-forge dlib
```
### Installation
You can just clone the repository.
```
git clone https://birdmandayum0131/virtual-bird.git
```
### Demo
Change directory to your project path and run demo.py
```
cd path/to/your/project/
python demo.py
```
  
If the camera window show sucessfully,  
you can use `l` `h` `a` commands to test **landmarks**„ÄÅ**head pose** and **head axis** features,  
and `q` to exist the program.  
  
  
If everything works normally, open the unity project in **unity/virtual-bird** folder with unity editor,  
and play the sample scene.  (Sorry I didn't export it to .exe file now.üê±‚ÄçüöÄ)  
  
  
You can change default config to fit your environments in **config/config.py**  

## Timeline
  - support Dlib Face/Landmarks Detector `2022/01/03`
  - change development environment to newer version(~~Of course, not hardware~~üò¢) `2021/12/27`
  - support OpenCV Head Pose Estimation `2021/12/26`
  - support OpenCV Gaze Tracking `2021/12/08`
  - support [FAN][] facial landmarks detector `2021/12/08`
  - support [Ghost][] character `2021/12/08`
